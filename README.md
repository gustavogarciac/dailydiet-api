# Daily Diet API - Front End

The Daily Diet API repository hosts the source code for an impactful API designed to support the Daily Diet application. This API empowers users by providing a versatile array of features, enabling seamless management of daily meals and facilitating progress tracking towards dietary aspirations.

The API enables users to log their meals with ease. By inputting essential details such as meal names, descriptions, timestamps, and compliance status with their dietary regimen, users can keep a comprehensive record of their nutritional intake.

  git clone git@github.com:gustavogarciac/dailydiet-api.git
